* History and Overview


* History of Go

.image _img/xkcd_compiling.png
.caption [[https://xkcd.com/303/]]

2007: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson start working on Go at Google
2008: Russ Cox (go mod) and Ian Taylor (gcc frontend) join
2009: Go goes Open Source
2012: Go version 1.0


* What is Go?

- A simple language that is easy to learn and read
- Statically typed, but with a dynamic feel
- Compiled to native machine code, but has a fast development cycle
- Language-level concurrency features
- Comprehensive and clear standard library
- Garbage collected
- Unicode support
- Great tools
- Open source

(Source: [[https://talks.golang.org/2012/zen.slide#2][Go and the Zen of Python]])


* What does Go look like?

Hello world in Go

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
	)

	func main() {
		fmt.Println("Hello, Melbourne ☕️🎸🏈❤️")
	}

Execute with

	language:bash
	go run hello.go


* What is Go NOT?

Go favours simplicity and directness resulting in some purposeful omissions:

- No type hierarchies or inheritance
- No exceptions
- No method overloading
- No generics
- No decorators
- No named or optional arguments
- No operator overloading
- No macros
- No arguments about code style :)


* Why Go

- simple: easy to learn and read
- a single obvious right way to do most things
- tools - `gofmt`, `goimports`, `godoc`, `go` `mod`, `go` `test`, `golangci-lint`, coverage
- standard library
- productive and fun
- lightweight concurrency

Here is a great read on Rob Pike's blog about "Why Go" - ([[https://commandcenter.blogspot.com/2012/06/less-is-exponentially-more.html][Less is Exponentially More]])

* Interlude: Towards Continuous Deployment


* What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?

Continuous Deployment != Continuous Delivery

.image _img/cd.jpg
.caption [[https://blog.crisp.se/2013/02/05/yassalsundman/continuous-delivery-vs-continuous-deployment][Yassal Sundman, Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment]]


* Continuous Deployment Quotes

"Continuous Deployment is a strategy for software releases wherein any code commit that passes the automated testing phase is automatically released into the production environment."
[[https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/definition/continuous-deployment][TechTarget definition]]


"Continuous deployment requires a highly developed culture of monitoring, being on call, and having the capacity to recover quickly."
[[https://semaphoreci.com/blog/2017/07/27/what-is-the-difference-between-continuous-integration-continuous-deployment-and-continuous-delivery.html][Marko Anastasov, Semaphore Engineering Blog]]


* Recommendations for CD (1/3)

- Use *trunk* *based* *development* (not GitFlow)
- Create *small* *PRs* (Pull Requests) that can be Squash Merged
- ... which lead to revertible commits that have passed automated tests
- Protect `master` branch on GitHub


* Recommendations for CD (2/3)

Quality leads to the confidence to automatically deploy, so we need
ways to increase and maintain quality.

- Write great commit messages
- Think about the reviewer and review your own PRs first
- *Lint* strictly `golangci-lint` `run`
- Ensure *100%* *coverage*


* Recommendations for CD (3/3)

- Test (unit & system), lint & cover as part of *CI* (Continuous Integration)
- *Version* all deployments (use [[https://semver.org/][semver]]; tag source, images etc.)
- *Document* for newbies in the README.md (must!) and use godoc
- Enjoy your CD as last step after successful CI run on master


* Protect master branch on GitHub

	language:none
	Settings -> Options:

* Commit messages - spot the difference

[[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/]]

	language:none
	$ git log --oneline -5 --author cbeams --before "Fri Mar 26 2009"

	e5f4b49 Re-adding ConfigurationPostProcessorTests after its brief removal in r814. @Ignore-ing the testCglibClassesAreLoadedJustInTimeForEnhancement() method as it turns out this was one of the culprits in the recent build breakage. The classloader hacking causes subtle downstream effects, breaking unrelated tests. The test method is still useful, but should only be run on a manual basis to ensure CGLIB is not prematurely classloaded, and should not be run as part of the automated build.
	2db0f12 fixed two build-breaking issues: + reverted ClassMetadataReadingVisitor to revision 794 + eliminated ConfigurationPostProcessorTests until further investigation determines why it causes downstream tests to fail (such as the seemingly unrelated ClassPathXmlApplicationContextTests)
	147709f Tweaks to package-info.java files
	22b25e0 Consolidated Util and MutableAnnotationUtils classes into existing AsmUtils
	7f96f57 polishing

versus

	language:none
	$ git log --oneline -5 --author pwebb --before "Sat Aug 30 2014"

	5ba3db6 Fix failing CompositePropertySourceTests
	84564a0 Rework @PropertySource early parsing logic
	e142fd1 Add tests for ImportSelector meta-data
	887815f Update docbook dependency and generate epub
	ac8326d Polish mockito usage


* Recipe for great commit messages

[[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/]]

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 60 characters
- *Capitalize* the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the *imperative* *mood* in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 80 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how


* Two git commands for precision work

- Use `git` `rebase` `-i` `COMMIT_HASH` to rework your commits if necessary
- Use `git` `add` `-p` for two separate concerns addressed in the one file

Don't be afraid!
Try it out on a new, throwaway branch.


* Rebase interactively

	language:none
	git log --oneline
	58b250e WIP
	d558e36 Add coverage and pre-pr checklist to README.md
	c9724be Fix copyright holder in LICENCE
	aa3b728 Added Apache 2.0 LICENSE
	8a2fd40 Initial commit

Drop the latest commit, reword `Added...` to `Add` and fold in the `Fix...` commit with:

	language:none
	git rebase -i 8a2fd40

and update commits in your editor with:

	language:none
	reword aa3b728 Added Apache 2.0 LICENSE
	fixup  c9724be Fix copyright holder in LICENCE
	pick   d558e36 Add coverage and pre-pr checklist to README.md
	drop   58b250e WIP


* Rebase a feature branch

Rebase will sequentially take the commits from `feature` and reapply them to `master`:

	language:none
	         A---B---C feature
	        /
	   D---E---F---G master

will become

	language:none
	                 A'--B'--C' feature
	                /
	   D---E---F---G master


Use the following commands:

	language:none
	git checkout master
	git pull upstream master # or just `git pull` if `master` is set to track `upstream/master`
	git checkout feature
	git rebase master
	git push -f


* Update branch on Github

For an existing PR you can alternatively click `Update` `branch` on Github.
This will merge `upstream/master` into `origin/feature`.
Before adding any commits to `feature` locally run:

	language:bash
	git pull origin feature



* Pull Request (PR) recommendations (1/2)

- Choose a meaningful *PR* *title*, it will become your Squash Merge message
- Fill in *PR* *description* and reference an Issue for instance with #6
- Review the *Files* *changed* tab - many reviewers start here
- Review the *Commits* tab - some reviewers start here
- Review the *Checks* tab - all checks must pass


* Pull Request (PR) recommendations (2/2)

- Think of the reviewer: your code needs to be reviewable and that should be a prime concern when writing your code, commits and PRs
- Tag your PR Title with `[WIP]` if adjustments are needed
- Rework fixup commits with `git` `rebase` `-i`  `COMMIT_HASH` and force push
- Add reviewers and remove `[WIP]` tag when all of the above are met
- Delete branch once merged, especially when using a single remote (no forks)

* Lab setup

* Prerequisites

- Install [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][git]]
- Install [[https://golang.org/doc/install][go 1.12]]
- Install [[https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint#install][golangci-lint]]

* Repository setup

- Login to github.com
- Click `Fork` in the top right corner of [[https://github.com/anz-bank/go-course]]
- Clone your fork. `USERNAME` is your GitHub username:

	language:none
	git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/go-course.git
	cd go-course

- Create `upstream` remote pointing to [[https://github.com/anz-bank/go-course][anz-bank/go-course]]:

	language:bash
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/anz-bank/go-course.git
	git remote update
	git branch -u upstream/master master
	git pull


* PR from own fork - typical git workflow

Start work on a new branch `lab1` with:

	git checkout master
	git pull upstream master  # with upstream/master tracking just use `git pull`
	git checkout -b lab1

Write, test and commit code code, then:

	git push -u origin

* Creating PRs

-  from `feature` branch of your own fork (remote `origin`)
-  to `master` on [[https://github.com/anz-bank/go-course][anz-bank/go-course]] (remote `upstream`)

Follow the [[https://github.com/anz-bank/go-course#pre-pr-checklist][PR checklist]] before submitting

When ready, submit and add the `Ready` `for` `review` tag

* Update feature branch

If `master` has advanced after `feature` branch and PR creation you have two options:

*Rebase* *feature* *branch*

	language:none
	git checkout master
	git pull upstream master # or just `git pull` if `master` is set to track `upstream/master`
	git checkout feature
	git rebase master
	git push -f

or

*Update* *branch* *on* *GitHub*

For an existing PR you can alternatively click `Update` `branch` on Github.
This will merge `upstream/master` into `origin/feature`.
Before adding any commits to `feature` locally run:

	language:bash
	git pull origin feature

* Lab PR approval flow - Programmer

- Label with the appropriate lab tag (eg: `lab1`)
- When ready, label with `Ready` `for` `review`
- Wait for PR to be labelled `Approved` `by` `colleague` or `Changes` `requested`
- If approved by colleague, wait for a CODEOWNER to approve and label with `Merge` `me`
- Merge

* Lab PR approval flow - Reviewer

- Remove `Ready` `for` `review` and add `Under` `review`
- Label with either `Approved` `by` `colleague` or `Changes` `requested` and remove `Under` `review`

	[a11y K8s abc]


* Data structures and interfaces

- [[https://goplay.space/#MYeoiSdP4tp][Pointers]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#eoBLEu8lRvl][Structs]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#OkA4buOlTe1][Methods]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#An9Um8oSShm][Interfaces]]

"The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction." - [[https://go-proverbs.github.io/][Rob Pike]]


* Embedding - Interfaces

"Go does not provide the typical, type-driven notion of subclassing, but it does have the ability to “borrow” pieces of an implementation by embedding types within a struct or interface." - [[https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding][Effective Go]]


	type Reader interface {
	    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
	}

	type Writer interface {
	    Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
	}

	// ReadWriter is the interface that combines the Reader and Writer interfaces.
	type ReadWriter interface {
	    Reader
	    Writer
	}


* Embedding - Structs

"When we embed a type, the methods of that type become methods of the outer type, but when they are invoked the receiver of the method is the inner type, not the outer one." - [[https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#embedding][Effective Go]]

- The same applies for all fields within an embedded type


* Precedence when Embedding

Embedding types introduces the possiblity for naming conflicts. Go follows some simple rules to help resolve this:

- A field or method `X` will hide any other field or method `X` found in a more deeply nested part of the type
- If a field or method appears at the same nesting level, it will return an error


* Examples

- [[https://goplay.space/#lAl70x0QACE][Embedded Structs]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#vLgi3SMtLZp][Embedded Interfaces]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#cmWFJ26jm2E][Precedence]]


* Lab 5 - Stringer

- Create an executable go program in directory `05_stringer/USERNAME`
- Make the `IPAddr` type implement `fmt.Stringer` to print the address as a dotted quad
- Find hints at [[https://tour.golang.org/methods/18][Tour of Go Exercise: Stringers]]
- Call `fmt.Println(IPAddr{127,` `0,` `0,` `1})` in `main` to print:

	127.0.0.1


* Go for Java devs

- [[https://goplay.space/#lQNE-kuVf-N][Functions are lambdas]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#HVSd6qpj74R][Typed constants are enums]]
- exported == public
- unexported == protected, not private
- There are no classes, though most types behave like them
- embedding == composition + inheritence
- map[type]struct{} == Set<type>
- [[https://goplay.space/#cL8GEUOhlb5][Beware of pointers]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#UF61v58dVYT][Pointers will also save your day]]


* Go for Java devs

- Not everything is object oriented. Pure functions are just fine
- Don't worry about abstraction up front, it is easy to abstract in go
- Don't worry about starting thousands of goroutines (worry when you get to millions)
- Don't worry about access scope within a package
- Don't worry about frameworks
- Don't worry about patterns
- Don't overstructure your project
- Remember to check for errors
- Don't fight the formatter
- Don't panic


* Test two implementations of interface in suite (1/2)

	// scaler.go
	type scaler interface {
		scale(float64)
	}

	type rect struct {
		a, b int
	}

	func (r *rect) scale(s float64) {
		r.a = int(float64(r.a) * s)
		r.b = int(float64(r.b) * s)
	}

	type circle struct {
		r int
	}

	func (c *circle) scale(s float64) {
		c.r = int(float64(c.r) * s)
	}


* Test two implementations of interface in suite (2/2)

	type scalerSuite struct {
		suite.Suite
		scaler scaler

* Lab 6 - CRUD puppy with interface

- Create an executable go program in directory `06_puppy/USERNAME` (see [[https://github.com/anz-bank/go-samplerest/blob/master/pkg/pet/types.go][hints]])
- Implement a `Puppy` struct containing `ID`, `Breed`, `Colour`, `Value`.
- Create `Storer` interface with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete][CRUD]] methods for `Puppy`
- Write a `MapStore` implementation of `Storer` backed by a `map`
- Write a `SyncStore` implementation of `Storer` backed by a [[https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Map][sync.Map]]
- Keep all implementation files in the same folder and in package `main`
- Test against the `Storer` interface and run in [[https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/suite][suite]] with both implementations

* Errors in Go

- `error` is a builtin interface ([[https://golang.org/src/builtin/builtin.go?s=11246:11286#L251][source: error]])
	type error interface {
		Error() string
	}
- Check errors explicitly

* Errors in Go (continued)

- The [[https://golang.org/pkg/errors/][`errors`]] package has functions for creating new error values
- Using [[https://golang.org/src/errors/errors.go?s=293:320#L1][`errors.New()`]]:

	func Sqrt(f float64) (float64, error) {
		if f < 0 {
			return 0, errors.New("math: square root of negative number")
		}
		// implementation
	}
- Alternatively using `fmt.Errorf`:
	if f < 0 {
		return 0, fmt.Errorf("math: square root of negative number %g", f)
	}

* Errors in Go (continued)

- Implement custom error types ([[https://golang.org/pkg/net/#AddrError][source: AddrError]]):
	type AddrError struct {
		Err  string
		Addr string
	}
	func (e *AddrError) Error() string {
		if e == nil {
			return "<nil>"
		}
		s := e.Err
		if e.Addr != "" {
			s = "address " + e.Addr + ": " + s
		}
		return s
	}
- Error values can be logged and printed:
	if _, err := Sqrt(-1); err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}

* Error Handling

- Check for the presence of an error by [[https://goplay.space/#40Ho_HWiYrb][comparing with nil]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#T2RkoxxpuUV][Comparing error values]]
- Errors are values so they can be [[https://goplay.space/#F_EG5jM_fZ6][programmed]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#bTOIkCkGssE][Handle errors gracefully]]
- Check errors using [[https://goplay.space/#ISKTAUFOyjk][type assertions]]
- By convention many standard library functions return `error` as the second return value

"Errors are values."  - [[https://go-proverbs.github.io/][Rob Pike]]

* Defer

- `defer` delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns
- When `defer` is called the parameters to the call are evaluated and saved
- Deferred functions are called when function returns or stack unwinds
- Syntax:
	defer <function call>
- Deferred functions are called [[https://goplay.space/#ZX5S9xyOS57][in reverse order]]
- Most commonly used for [[https://goplay.space/#mh9MhO9rDXt][resource cleanup]] (close IO resources, release locks etc.)

* Panic and Recover

- `panic` and `recover` are builtin functions
- `panic` and `recover` behave similar to `throw/catch` in other languages
- `panic`:
	func panic(interface{})
- `panic` unwinds the stack, calling deferred functions up to the top-level function of the executing goroutine
- `recover` (see next slide) can intercept this unwinding
- Without `recover`, the program is terminated and the error condition is reported

* Panic and Recover

- `recover`:
	func recover() interface{}
- `recover` allows a program to handle panic called in another function
- Must be called from within a deferred function in the same goroutine
- Returns the value passed by call to panic

* Don't Panic

- Panic could terminate the goroutine or the program
- Use `panic` rarely and judiciously in your own code
- Use it in deeply nested internal methods/functions and return an error/status to the caller
- Don't `panic` across package boundaries
- Don't make a panic part of a package's API, instead always recover at the interface level of the package and return an error
- [[https://goplay.space/#fFiO42mIOHo][Basic illustration of panic]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#c8XO7QBMfA5][Basic illustration of panic and recover]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#V5ckmhsPUHv][Recover and return value]]

* Lab 7 - Errors

- Create an executable go program in directory `07_errors/USERNAME`
- Copy the CRUD puppy from upstream master `06_puppy/USERNAME`
- Add a custom error type `Error` with fields `Message` and `Code`
- Extend the `Storer` interface for all methods to also return `error`
- Create errors for:

	language:none
	- Value < 0
	- ID not found in Read, Update and Delete

- Add locking for proper use of sync.Map
- Bonus points: Add a third `Storer` implementation using [[https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb][LevelDB]]

* Go Concurrency

* Topics

- Concurrency
- Concurrency in Go
- Goroutines
- Channels
- Range & Select
- Under the hood: Processes, Threads, Goroutines
- Under the hood: Go Runtime

* Concurrency

Definition

- Concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing][Source: Wikipedia]])
- Parallelism is the ability to run different parts or units of a program simultaneously

[[https://go-proverbs.github.io/][Rob Pike]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso][Talk]], [[https://talks.golang.org/2012/waza.slide][Slides]])

- "Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating."
- "Concurrency is not parallelism."
- "Concurrency is about structure, parallelism is about execution."

* Concurrency in Go

* Background: Process, Threads and OS Scheduling

.image _img/process.png
.caption [[https://randu.org/tutorials/threads/]]

- Large (default 2 Mb on Linux) stack size
- 1x1 mapping between user and kernel threads

* Go Runtime

- Scheduling, Memory Management, Garbage Collection

.image _img/go_runtime.png
.caption [[http://bit.ly/30uMfhm]]

* Goroutines and Scheduler

- Goroutine is an extremely lightweight thread of execution
- Low initial stack size (2 Kb) that grows
- Runs concurrently like threads
- Scheduler tracks goroutines and schedules them to run on a set of OS threads
- GOMAXPROCS and runtime.GOMAXPROCS() sets the number of OS threads
- [[https://play.golang.org/p/2sr6XrkGYKz][Start a goroutine]] using a `go` statement
	go <function-call>
- Concurrency is not parallelism ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso][Talk]], [[https://talks.golang.org/2012/waza.slide][Slides]])

A good read about details of Go scheduler [[https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part1.html][here]]

Go provides:

- Concurrent execution (goroutines)
- Synchronisation and message passing (channels)
- Multi-way concurrent control (select)

* Channels

- Communication mechanism (conduit) that lets goroutines exchange data
- Each channel allows goroutines to send/receive a particular data type (called element type)
- Declare channel using `chan` keyword
- Create unbuffered channel
	ch := make(chan int) // ch is an unbuffered channel of `int` element type
- Create buffered channel
	ch := make(chan int, 10) // ch is a buffered channel of size 10 and type `int`
- Close channel using `close()` function

* Channel Operations

- Send and Receive values with the channel operator <-

	ch <- v // send v to the channel ch
	v := <-ch // receive from ch and assign it to v

- Send to buffered channel blocks only when the channel is full
- Receive from a channel blocks when the channel is empty
- Sender can close the channel to indicate no more values will be sent
- Receiver can test whether a channel has been closed

	v, ok := <-ch // ok is false if channel is closed and no more data is available

- Sending message on a closed/nil channel causes the program to panic
- Receive on a closed channel never blocks

* Channel Operations (continued)

- Range on a channel

	for v := range ch {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}

- Range over a channel that never closes never finishes

* Channel Examples

- [[https://play.golang.org/p/dIQTgdZ2kvQ][Send and receive on an unbuffered channel]]
- [[https://play.golang.org/p/DVkhMmqfs_x][Send and receive on a buffered channel]]
- [[https://play.golang.org/p/840nqny9Y4D][Receive from a channel using 'range']]

- Add project introduction and how to build, run & test it to `README.md`



* Go tool chain

	language:bash
	go help
	go version
	go build ./...
	go test ./...
	go install ./...
	go mod init
	go mod vendor
	go mod tidy
	go clean -modcache
	go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -html=coverage.out


* Other tools

Lint with

	golangci-lint run

and configure the linter in `.golangci.yml`

Use `gofmt` or `goimport` as part of your editor/IDE setup


* Go standard library

[[https://golang.org/pkg/]]
- fmt
- strings
- time
- [[https://goplay.space/#zp5qANw7LCZ][encoding/json]]
- net/http
- regexp
- sort
- database/sql
- os
- path
- bytes
- ...


* JSON - (De-)Serialisation

- `Marshal` converts a value into a JSON byte array
- `Unmarshal` converts a JSON-encoded byte array into a value
- An `Encoder` marshals values as JSON to a stream (`io.Writer`) 
- A `Decoder` unmarshals JSON-encoded values from a stream (`io.Reader`)

	func Marshal(v interface{}) ([]byte, error) { /* ... */ }

	func Unmarshal(data []byte, v interface{}) error { /* ... */ }


* JSON - Field Tags

- Attach a 'json' field tag to customise (un)marshalling
- Common error is making Go fields private (lower case) which results in the fields not being (un)marshalled


	type Car struct {
		Manufacturer string `json:"manufacturer"`
		Model        string `json:"model"`
		Year         int64  `json:"year,omitempty"`
	}


* JSON - Zero Values

- All Go struct fields will be set to their type's zero value if the corresponding JSON property is missing.
- Pointer types have a zero value of `nil`
- To be able to differentiate between a field which has been set explicitly to it's zero value or omitted, you must use pointer types


* Examples

- [[https://goplay.space/#lYdq4Jg19EP][JSON Marshal / Unmarshal]]
- [[https://goplay.space/#KkPDLf_PvQP][JSON Zero Values]]


* Lab 9 - JSON puppy

- Create directory `09_json/USERNAME` containing a copy of upstream master `08_project/USERNAME`
- Add JSON tags to puppy data type
- Test marshalling and unmarshalling using [[https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require#JSONEq][require.JSONEq]]
- Add command line flag `-d` `FILE` with long form `--data` `FILE` using [[https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/alecthomas/kingpin.v2][kingpin.v2]]. FILE should contain an array of puppies in JSON format. Parse this file and store its contents.

		mt.maxID++ // Race condition
		teapot.ID = mt.maxID
		mt.store[mt.maxID] = teapot
		render.JSON(w, r, teapot)
	}


* Lab 10 - Puppy REST

- Create directory `10_rest/USERNAME` containing a copy of upstream master `09_json/USERNAME`
- Add file `pkg/puppy/rest.go` implementing:

	GET    /api/puppy/{id}
	POST   /api/puppy/          Payload: Puppy JSON without ID
	PUT    /api/puppy/{id}      Payload: Puppy JSON without ID
	DELETE /api/puppy/{id}

- Use [[https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptest/][net/http/httptest]] for testing
- Add flag `-p` `PORT` with long flag `--port` `PORT` to command line flags
- Add flag `-s` `STORE` with long flag `--store` `STORE` with accepted values:

	map, sync, db

- Document the API in README.md


* Lab 11 - Puppy Notifications

- Create directory `11_notify/USERNAME` containing a copy of upstream master `10_rest/USERNAME`
- Create `cmd/lostpuppy-service/main.go` running single endpoint:

	POST   /api/lostpuppy/          Payload: { id: PUPPY_ID }

- This stubbed endpoint returns with 2 second delay:

	HTTP status 201 for even IDs
	HTTP status 500 for odd IDs

- Update Puppy `Delete` method to notify lostpuppy-service in a goroutine and log response code asynchronously.
